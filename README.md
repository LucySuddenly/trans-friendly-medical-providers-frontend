# Trans-Friendly Medical Providers Frontend

This is a proof-of-concept project for a user-driven collection of trans-friendly medical providers.

## Motivation

Trans people may be denied medical services for a number of reasons. This app aims to crowdsource positive reports from trans people to ensure easier access to care for others.

* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)
